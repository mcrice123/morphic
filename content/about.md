## Author

My name is **Maria Rice** and I make websites for a living. 
In my spare time, I like to read comics and graphic novels. 
**I am a self-taught artist, with years of experience drawing in traditional ink and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).**

## Plot

A plea for help from a mysterious girl sidetracks **Errie Bright**&#42; and **Lane Valerie** on their way to a local festival. 
Fooled at first by the expectation of seeing people dressed up for the same event, the girls soon realize that the people they meet in the woods that day are _not in costume..._

They are shape-shifting beings called **morphics**. 

## Medium

The project started with lineart-only pages and I am currently in the process of coloring them. 
I draw the pages with black fineliner ink pen and use 
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) 
to add text bubbles and color.

## History

I wrote the first finished plot line for "Morphic" in the **spring of 2016** and later that year I began drawing and posting pages on the internet. 
Starting in 2018, I switched from uploading lineart-only pages to fully-colored, cell-shaded pages. 

## Printing

I plan to print and sell copies of all 3 books in the series by the **end of 2026**. 
As an independent author and artist, I consider crowdfunding as my best option for publishing "Morphic".
