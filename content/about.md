# The Author
**My name is Maria Rice** and I am a web developer by trade 
with a passion for reading web comics, graphic novels, comic 
books, etc. **And I enjoy comics so much that I make one of 
my very own!**


# The Plot

Meet Erica "Errie" Bright, a regular teenaged girl who 
discovers the existence of powerful beings called Morphics 
just outside her hometown of Ash Root.

### What are 'Morphics'?

Powerful beings with the ability to switch between either of 
two forms:
  
  1. That of an animal
  2. That which is similar to a human, but with some animal 
  features corresponding to their animal form.

A Morphic can have more abilities in addition to his/her 
transformation ability.

# History

I wrote the first finished plot line for "Morphic" in the 
spring of 2016. I posted the first drawn pages in September 
of that same year and have been uploading pages weekly ever 
since. 

"Morphic" was going to be a 5-book series, but after 
discovering how much time and effort it takes to produce 
one book, I changed it to a 3-book series.

# Medium

Although I hope to gradually add color to the pages as the 
project grows, for now I show it in the original black and 
white to keep the story going. I draw the pages with black 
ink pen and add the speech bubbles with 
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

# Thanks For Visiting

as much as I enjoy creating it!
