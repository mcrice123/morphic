Gosh...some days it feels like I go overboard on these inks, _but talk about shading 
a darkened room!_ 

However, I do really like how the color-shading pops out in this page.

# Status Update: Buffer Complete!

Every weekly update from now until the end of finals week is finished and ready to 
upload. As I wrap up this semester I'll upload these posts, but I won't focus on drawing
more pages until I'm close to done with school. **Believe me, by that time my hands will 
be itching to do more drawing and coloring!**

Thanks for reading! Come back next week for more ~~mopiness~~**---ehhhh---**_in-depth shading of Errie's room!_

_(cough-cough)_

Just kidding. It's got at least _one_ exciting thing in it...
