_Introductions exchanged._

## A new 'first'

I’ve had an interesting two weeks since my last post. I delivered my first-ever art commission! That was fun. I was a little nervous, but it turned out great.

Today I started drawing the next batch of new pages! I’ll share my progress on those pages with the next post. 

## In other news

I had been using a work laptop to draw pages lately and now I'm switching to another device. 
There's a _slight_ chance of delay in page updates if I run into issues with the new laptop, but I'm not too worried about that. 
I just wanted to make a note of it beforehand in case problems _do_ happen and I'll be sure to post an update about it if _any_ delay is necessary. 

## Thanks for reading!

Have a great weekend! I’ll be back again with the next page in two weeks.
