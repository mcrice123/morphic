### SURPRISE!

I said last week that I *might* have a redrawn and 
colored page for Book 1. I am happy to announce...
**I have two!**

Check out pages [1](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-01/)
and [37](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-37/)!

# Thanks for reading!

Check out next week's page update to find out what happens 
and maybe---*maybe*---you'll get to see another redone page 
from Book 1! Have a great weekend!
