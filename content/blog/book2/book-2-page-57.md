_Everyone’s talking about death all of a sudden…_

## Almost finished with the next batch of pages

I got a lot done these past two weeks! 
I began four more pages and already started coloring them. 
By the time I post the last page in my buffer (which comes right after today’s page), I’ll have 4 more to add to it, which should cover the page updates for another two months!

## I have a “New” MacBook!

I am very happy with my new device. 
Many thanks to my friend for giving it to me so that I don’t have to buy a very expensive replacement! 
And I am happy that I was able to transition everything I need to it pretty easily. 

## Thanks for reading!

Have a great weekend! I’ll be back again with the next page in two weeks.
