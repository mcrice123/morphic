# Where have we seen this guy before...?

Oh yeah---it's *Chan*! The kid who skipped out on going to the 
festival with his friends and thereby ended up missing out on an 
exciting (and slightly terrifying) adventure in the woods. 

YEP. That's him! 

Don't worry, you'll be seeing a lot more of him 
in this book... *[cackles quietly and ominously]*

### In other news

The next two pages actually took the most time to produce out of all 
my colored pages so far! Despite that, I'm especially looking 
forward to posting them because I think they came out really well!

So come check them out next week and the week after when they're 
uploaded! Thanks for reading and have a great week!
