# The Burning Question

Errie's a little surprised to be regaining her mother's 
trust so quickly.

### A Small update

Before last week, I was producing two colored pages per week 
for Book 2, with the intent of reaching a buffer of 8 pages.
Since last week, I decided to slow down to producing one 
page per week, settling for a buffer of 5 pages. 

...Or, rather 3 pages currently. I'm still working on the 
two latest pages. 

### But hey---Another Colored Page for Book 1!

Check out [page 34](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-34/)
of Book 1!

### Thanks for reading!

Check out next week's post for the wrap-up of this scene!

...*And* maybe another colored page for Book 1, if I have 
time.

Have a great weekend!
