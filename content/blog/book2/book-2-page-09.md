# Early Update

I'm going out of town this week, so I'm posting this page 
today. I finished page 10 as expected, so I have no worries 
about posting it on time next week. **Yay for meeting 
deadlines!**

Anyways, now we get more of an explanation about the jar 
referenced in the last page of Book 1. 

### Thanks for reading! 

Next week's page will have a change in pace, so remember to 
come back and check out what happens!
