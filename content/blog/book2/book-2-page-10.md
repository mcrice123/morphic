# The fox is in

I like how Errie's mom came out in panel 5. Really shows her
protective side.

I'm in the process of coloring the next two pages, so I plan on
uploading page 11 next week as planned. 

# Thanks for reading!

Come back next week to find out what happens on the next page. Have 
a good Memorial Day weekend!
