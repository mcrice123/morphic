_It's WOLF!_

I am thrilled to finally reveal his other form! 
I'm also looking forward to drawing him a lot more in the upcoming pages. 

**In addition, I am very proud of the gawking faces I drew in that last panel!**

## Current progress

At the time of my last post, I had started the initial drawings of pages 47 through 50. 
**Since then, I got the inking, text, and base coloring stages finished on all those pages!** 
All that's left now is shading and lighting, the final stage! 

I am making such good progress that **I may have some free days at the end of January** before I start on next month's goal. 
I'm considering ways of rewarding myself for getting a monthly goal done early.
I'll probably take a few days' break. 

**It feels _great_ to be ahead of schedule!**
