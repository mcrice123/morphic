**OUT INTO THE SUN AT LAST!**

I got two more pages drawn and inked this week---**_YAY!_**
I expect to have those done by the end of next week.

#  Colored Page 15 is up!

Check out [page 15 of Book 1](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-15/) to see 
the new changes!

Also, I'm _hoping_ this is a local server issue when I 
'test run' the post, but in case it is also an issue with 
the public-side of the website...well. Let's just say, try 
as I might, I couldn't re-orient page 15 of Book 1 into 
portrait layout---**which is WEIRD**. The file shows up in the 
correct orientation and I open it in another app and it 
displays correctly, but then I run the server and **WHAT 
the WHAT** is going on?!

So if it shows up that way when you browse to it, **yeah, 
that's a bug**. I'll know about _that_ one anyway...

However...

### Please let me know if you notice any other pages displaying wrong

This is the first and only page I had issues with...I'm wondering
if it's a bug from an update. I'll be looking into that, but 
any feedback on Facebook or on the comments below (or Github, if 
you fancy) is appreciated.

### Thanks for reading!

Come back next week to see who's talking in that last panel!
Also, I'll be posting an extra something, celebrating 
**2 years** since I first started drawing "Morphic"! Stay 
tuned and have a great weekend!
